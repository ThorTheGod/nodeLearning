# nodelearning
This is my node.js learning code and note.
 In fact ,i am not sure whether i will be the man i want to be. However. Why not have a try? I believe that everything i had lost is still by my side,even though i cannot see them. My life is so fucking a shit that I can't always fulfill my dream or get what I desire to. But I can realize all of them by code. I am the god in my world.I am Thor. And you too.
